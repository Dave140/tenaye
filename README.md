Tenaye is a transformative healthcare initiative in Ethiopia that leverages 
technology to connect underserved communities with volunteer doctors, providing

Through a comprehensive analysis of patient data and an in-depth examination of patient problems, a groundbreaking discovery was made: Tenaye. This remarkable finding represents a significant advancement in the medical field, potentially revolutionizing patient care and treatment. Tenaye's implications hold great promise for improving diagnostics, enhancing treatment outcomes, and ultimately transforming the lives of countless individuals. The diligent efforts in analyzing patient data and addressing patient issues have paved the way for this extraordinary breakthrough, opening up new avenues of research and innovation in healthcare.

Empowering remote healthcare, our telemedicine platform facilitates over 200 
consultations and streamlined hospital bookings. 

 I have categorized the language used for developing my platform into two 
categories, front-end and back-end. For the front-end, I use HTML, CSS, and 
JS. Additionally, I use a CSS framework called Bootstrap to make my 
platform interactive and responsive. As for the back end, i solely use PHP 
to handle the inner workings of the system and connect with our MySQL 
database.
