# tenaye
Tenaye is a transformative healthcare initiative in Ethiopia that leverages 
technology to connect underserved communities with volunteer doctors, providing 
free and paid consultations through a user-friendly mobile and web-based platform. 
By addressing the barriers of limited access to primary healthcare services, Tenaye 
aims to improve health outcomes, increase health awareness, and reduce healthcare 
disparities. With a vision for universal access to healthcare, Tenaye strives to 
create a sustainable and scalable healthcare ecosystem, collaborating with 
stakeholders and utilizing innovative solutions to ensure that every individual, 
regardless of their financial means or location, can receive timely and quality 
medical care. 

Empowering remote healthcare, our telemedicine platform facilitates over 200 
consultations and streamlined hospital bookings. 

 I have categorized the language used for developing my platform into two 
categories, front-end and back-end. For the front-end, I use HTML, CSS, and 
JS. Additionally, I use a CSS framework called Bootstrap to make my 
platform interactive and responsive. As for the back end, i solely use PHP 
to handle the inner workings of the system and connect with our MySQL 
database.
